# Response Patterns

For each referee or coauthor request:

1. restate the request,
2. define the exact rerun or robustness check,
3. capture the output and any changed interpretation,
4. note what remains unchanged,
5. preserve the audit trail.

Avoid sprawling exploratory reruns that are not tied to the criticism being answered.

Use `stata run` for each specified model, `stata results` to capture point estimates and standard errors, and `stata log tail` to preserve the execution trail.
