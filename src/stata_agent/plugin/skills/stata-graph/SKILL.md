description: List, export, and review Stata graphs from the current session.

1. Call `stata graph list` to see all graphs in memory, with the active graph marked.

2. If an argument (graph name) was provided:
   - Call `stata graph export --name <graph_name> --format png` and display the exported file path.

3. If no argument was provided and graphs exist:
   - Call `stata graph export-all --format png` to export all graphs.
   - Display all exported file paths for the user to inspect.

4. If no graphs are in memory, tell the user to create a graph first (e.g., `stata run "histogram price"` or `stata run "scatter price mpg"`).

After export, review the graph(s): check titles, axis labels, legends, and whether the plot matches expectations. Report any issues.
