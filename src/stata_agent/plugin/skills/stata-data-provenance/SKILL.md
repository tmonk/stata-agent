# Data Provenance

Use this skill when lineage and reproducibility matter.

1. Map the sequence of source files and transformations.
2. Flag untracked merges, overwrites, and silent sample restrictions.
3. Produce a concise provenance narrative a coauthor can audit.

Use `stata run` to trace the pipeline steps and `stata inspect describe` to check dataset state at each stage. Review the Stata log with `stata log errors` and `stata log tail` to detect warnings from merge or append operations.

Read `references/lineage.md` for the provenance checklist.
