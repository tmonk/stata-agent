# Modernize Stata

Use this skill when a user wants stronger Stata code, not just working Stata code.

1. Identify the current anti-patterns.
2. Recommend or implement modern replacements with clear rationale.
3. Favor frames, `reghdfe`, `gtools`, portable paths, and explicit state handling.

Use `stata lint <path>` to detect issues automatically, then review the results and suggest modern alternatives. Use `stata run` to test replacements.

Read `references/patterns.md` for common replacements and examples.
